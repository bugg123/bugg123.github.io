Profile: I'm a developer who loves learning and continually trying to make things better.  I have a lot of interest in developer experience and helping them get their software to cloud quickly and more easily.  I continually try to find or create tools to automate and speed up those processes.  I love open source software and the community around it. I would like to become more involved and would value opportunities that embrace those communities.
